##### Overview of Res-IRF model

The Res-IRF model is a tool for simulating energy consumption and energy efficiency improvements in the French
residential building sector. It currently focuses on space heating as the main usage. The rationale for its development
is to integrate a detailed description of the energy performance of the dwelling stock with a rich description of
household behaviour. Res-IRF has been developed to improve the behavioural realism that is typically lacking in integrated
models of energy demand.

##### User interface description

This web app allows reading output files of Res-IRF 3.0 from previous simulation.  
This application does not allow performing original simulations. For that see directly the 
[GitHub repository]((https://github.com/lucas-vivier/Res-IRF)).
